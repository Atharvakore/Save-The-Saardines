- Chemicals don't disperse when they move into deep ocean.
- We need to remove trackers from garbage when it is removed from the simulation.
- Collecting ship behaviours are not implemented for collecting plastic garbage with more than one ship at once.
- Off-by-one errors in event/task handling.
- Corporation information is not extensive enough, some scouting ships go exploring instead of investigating garbage, because they do not see it.
- Drifting is completely and irredeemably broken.
- cooperate task: cooperating with other corp harbor
------------#OFFICE HOUR NOTES
- collecting same garbage -probably loop
- no such element when moving ships
- account for velocity & acceleration when move ships
- ship moving on same tick as task
- moving ships is not behaving correctly
- conccurent modification in process events (dont cut the line -- AFTER LOGGING)


- oil drifting wrong id (new id is drifted and then we are splitting)
- return to harbor to unload for secondary containers and capabilites is not done
- ships move to harbor even without enough fuel (should be fixed)
- speed should return to 0 after cooperating
- scouting ship visibility range is not added when it has task
- storm event should update the knowledge of corporation
- unload only in the next tick
- scouting ships should go to scout the information they get from cooperate task


hints for mutant
- erorr404: event tile id should exist
- multitasking: there shouldn't be tasks with same reward
- free gift: if you don't find any garbage you recieve no rewards
- microscopic: telescopes reward should be recieved after task
