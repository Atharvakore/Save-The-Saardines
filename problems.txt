- Chemicals don't disperse when they move into deep ocean.
- We need to remove trackers from garbage when it is removed from the simulation.
- Collecting ship behaviours are not implemented for collecting plastic garbage with more than one ship at once.
- Off-by-one errors in event/task handling.
- Corporation information is not extensive enough, some scouting ships go exploring instead of investigating garbage, because they do not see it.
- Drifting is completely and irredeemably broken.
- cooperate task: cooperating with other corp harbor
------------#OFFICE HOUR NOTES
- collecting same garbage -probably loop
- no such element when moving ships
- account for velocity & acceleration when move ships
- ship moving on same tick as task
- moving ships is not behaving correctly
- conccurent modification in process events (dont cut the line -- AFTER LOGGING)
- coordinating ships can see the garbage in its visibility range
