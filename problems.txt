- Chemicals don't disperse when they move into deep ocean.
- We need to remove trackers from garbage when it is removed from the simulation.
- Collecting ship behaviours are not implemented for collecting plastic garbage with more than one ship at once.
- Off-by-one errors in event/task handling.
- Corporation information is not extensive enough, some scouting ships go exploring instead of investigating garbage, because they do not see it.
